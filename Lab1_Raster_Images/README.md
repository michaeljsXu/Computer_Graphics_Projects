# Computer Graphics ‚Äì Raster Images

### Read Chapter 3 of _Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (4th Edition)_.

The most common digital representation of a color image is a 2D array of
red/green/blue intensities at pixels. Since each entry in the array is actually
a 3-vector of color values, we can interpret an image as a 3-tensor or 3D array.
Memory on the computer is addressed linear, so an RGB image with a certain
`width` and `height` will be represented as `width*height*3` numbers. How these
numbers are ordered is a matter of convention. In our assignment we use the
convention that the red value of pixel in the top-left corner comes first, then
its green value, then its blue value, and then the rgb values of its neighbor to
the right and so on _across_ the row of pixels, and then moving to the next row
_down_ the columns of rows.

### Alpha map

Natural images (e.g., photographs) only require color information, but to
manipulate images it is often useful to also store a value representing how much
of a pixel is "covered" by the given color. Intuitively this value (called alpha
or <img src="c745b9b57c145ec5577b82542b2df546.svg" align=middle width=10.57650494999999pt height=14.15524440000002pt/> represents how opaque (the opposite of _transparent_) each pixel is.
When we store rgb + Œ± image as a _4_-channel rgba image. Just like rgb images,
rgba images are 3D arrays unrolled into a linear array in memory.

.png files can store rgba images, whereas our simpler .ppm file format only
stores grayscale or rgb images.

### .ppm files

We'll use a very basic _uncompressed_ image file format to write out the results
of our tasks: the [.ppm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format#File_format_description).

Like many image file formats, .ppm uses 8 bits per color value. Color
intensities are represented as an integer between `0` (0% intensity) and `255`
(100% intensity). In our programs we will use `unsigned char` to represent these
values when reading, writing and doing simple operations. For numerically
sensitive computations (e.g., conversion between rgb and hsv), it is convenient
to convert values to decimal representations using [double precision floating
point
numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format)
`0` is converted to `0.0` and `255` to `1.0`.

To simplify the implementation and to help with debugging, we will use the
text-based .ppm formats for this assignment.

## Grayscale Images

Surprisingly there are
[many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale#Converting_color_to_grayscale)
acceptable and reasonable ways to convert a color image into a
[grayscale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale) ("black and white") image.
The complexity of each method scales with the amount that method accommodates
for human perception. For example, a very naive method is to average red, green
and blue intensities. A slightly better (and very popular method) is to take a
weighted average giving higher priority to green:

## Mosaic images

The raw color measurements made by modern digital cameras are typically stored
with a single color channel per pixel. This information is stored as a seemingly
1-channel image, but with an understood convention for interpreting each pixel
as the red, green or blue intensity value given some pattern. The most common is
the [Bayer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter).  In this
assignment, we'll assume the top left pixel is green, its right neighbor is blue
and neighbor below is red, and its
[kitty-corner](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kitty-corner#Adverb) neighbor is
also green.

> Q: Why are more sensors devoted to green?

To _demosaic_ an image, we would like to create a full rgb image without
downsampling the image resolution. So for each pixel, we'll use the exact color
sample when it's available and average available neighbors (in all 8 directions)
to fill in missing colors. This simple [linear
interpolation-based](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~majumder/PHOTO/DemosaicingAndWhiteBalancing.pdf)
method has some blurring artifacts and can be improved with more complex
methods.

![The Bayer-pattern image on the left has "exact" measurements of red, green and
blue colors at different pixels. The missing color information at each pixel
needs to be interpolated from neighbors (4 or 2). _Just do "something
reasonable" for pixels on the very boundary of the image._ [image source](bayer-info.png) ](images/bayer-info.png)

## Color representation

RGB is just one way to represent a color. Another useful representation is store
the [hue, saturation, and value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) of a
color. This "hsv" representation also has 3-channels: typically, the
[hue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue) or `h` channel is stored in degrees
(i.e., on a periodic scale) in the range <img src="79e8ecba3844cf52c00856dfc8f397ea.svg" align=middle width=64.42934684999999pt height=24.65753399999998pt/> and the
[saturation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorfulness) `s` and
[value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightness) `v` are given as absolute
values in <img src="/tex/acf5ce819219b95070be2dbeb8a671e9.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=32.87674994999999pt height=24.65753399999998pt/>.

[Converting between rgb and
hsv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV#Converting_to_RGB) is
straightforward and makes it easy to implement certain image changes such as
shifting the hue of an image (e.g., Instagram's "warmth" filter) and the
saturation of an image (e.g., Instagram's "saturation" filter).

### Groundrules

Implementations of nearly any task you're asked to implemented in this course
can be found online. Do not copy these and avoid _googling for code_; instead,
search the internet for explanations. Many topics have relevant wikipedia
articles. Use these as references. Always remember to cite any references in
your comments.

#### White List
